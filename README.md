KOLEJ VOKASIONAL KUALA SELANGOR

The Online Printing System, also known as Sistem Cetakan Atas Talian (sCAT), is a web-based application designed to simplify and digitize the document printing process for students at Kolej Vokasional Kuala Selangor (KVKS). Developed by students as part of an innovation initiative, this system allows users to submit, manage, and track their printing requests entirely online â€” reducing paperwork, saving time, and increasing workflow efficiency for the Student Representative Council (Majlis Perwakilan Pelajar - MPP).
